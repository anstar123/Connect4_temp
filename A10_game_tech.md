## Algorithm Analysis and Game Theory

### 1. Game Environment
#### 1.1 State Space
- Board Size: 8x8 matrix
- Piece Types: 4 (black regular, black king, red regular, red king)
- Empty Space: 1 type
- Total Possible States: Extremely large but finite
- Initial State: 12 pieces per player, alternating positions

#### 1.2 Action Space
- Regular Moves: Diagonal movement (1 square)
- Capture Moves: Diagonal jumps (2 squares)
- King Promotions: When reaching opposite end
- Valid Actions: Depends on current board state and piece type

#### 1.3 Game Rules
- Turn-based gameplay
- Mandatory captures
- King movement in all directions
- Regular pieces move in one direction only
- Game termination conditions:
  * No pieces remaining
  * No valid moves
  * Threefold repetition
  * 100 moves without capture
  * Repetitive move pattern

- Where:
  * b = branching factor
  * d = search depth

#### 5.2 Space Complexity
- Board representation: O(1)
- Move history: O(n)
- Board states: O(3)
- Where n = number of moves

#### 5.3 Performance Tracking
- Nodes explored
- Search time
- Move count
- Capture count

### 6. Evaluation Function
#### 6.1 Components
- Material count
